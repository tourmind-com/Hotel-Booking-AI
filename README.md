# Hotel Booking AI

Hotel Booking AI helps users book hotels with live prices and availability.

Search destinations or hotel names, compare real-time room rates, verify rooms before booking, create reservations, check or cancel orders, and pay with WeChat Pay or Alipay. Use it only for explicit hotel booking, room-rate, booking-status, cancellation, or payment requests.

## Features

- **Search regions / hotels** — fuzzy search by city name, landmark, or hotel name
- **Search hotel list** — find the cheapest hotels by region and dates
- **Query room rates** — get all room types and live prices for a given hotel
- **Verify price & lock room** — lock in the rate to make sure it is still valid before booking
- **Create booking** — submit the order; Chinese / English names are parsed automatically
- **Query booking** — check the order status and confirmation number any time
- **Cancel booking** — cancel an existing booking after user confirmation
- **Initiate payment** — supports WeChat Pay and Alipay

## ClawHub Install

```bash
openclaw skills install @tourmind/hotel-booking-ai
```

The published ClawHub slug is `hotel-booking-ai`.

## Quick Deploy

### 1. Start the Skill HTTP Server

```bash
go build -o chls-skill ./mcp/cmd/
nohup ./chls-skill -port :9061 > chls-skill.log 2>&1 &
```

The required environment variables are the same as the main service (database, RPC endpoints, etc.).

### 2. Install the Skill Locally

Copy `SKILL.md` to the local skills directory and restart the gateway:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/hotel-booking-ai
cp SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/skills/hotel-booking-ai/
openclaw gateway restart
```

No MCP server needs to be configured in `openclaw.json` — the skill calls the HTTP API directly.
